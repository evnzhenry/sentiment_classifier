- Exec: Dataset coverage, initial F1/accuracy, and infra assumptions (CPU/GPU).
- KPIs: latency < 1h, macro-F1 ≥ baseline, coverage ≥ target langs.
- Detail TF-IDF math, regularization in LogReg, calibration for SVC.
- EDA details: label distribution, per-language counts, char/token stats.
- PCA pending; include variance and loadings when generated.
- Awaiting metrics; once ready, add thresholds for green/yellow/red statuses.
- Infra: batch inference on CPU, transformer finetuning on GPU when needed.
- Owners, timelines, and dependency tracking.
- Provide brief math references and citations.
- Bias and fairness checks, data governance, opt-in/opt-out policies.
- Define decision gates, budget, and resource allocations.
- Detail cleaning steps and configuration options.
